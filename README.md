### Single neuron unimodal DGM
---

#### VAE models
Here one can find tools to execute and benchmark 6 different VAE architectures originated from combinations of the following features:
- **Learned/ Fixed Var**: The variance of the likelihood $p_\theta(x\mid z)$ is Learned/Fixed.
- **Supervised model**: The batch labels are concatenated with the input to remove batch effect in the latent representation.
- **Denoising model**: A random mask $m$ is applied at each epoch, concatenaed with the data ($[x,m]$) and fed into the encoder. The goal is to make the model more robust to missing data.

#### Code
- `train_dgm.py`: train the chosen out of the 6 models and evaluating the latent representation and reconstruction using different metrics.
- `sim_benchmark_dgm.sh`: run `train_dgm.py` for specified parameters.
- `train_effa.py`:  train Bayesian Factor Analysis model.
- `sim_benchmark_effa.sh`: run `train_effa.py` for specified parameters.
- `benchmark.py`: plot representation and reconstruction metrics.
- `train_dgm_real_data.py`: train the chosen out of 6 models on real data from primary cortical cultures.
- `benchmark_real_data.sh`: plot representation and reconstruction metrics for real data.

### Single neuron multimodal DGM
---
This model presents an extension of the Supervised unimodal VAE (SVAE) by adding transcriptomic data as input, therefore building a multimodal SVAE (MSVAE). In this case, 2 encoders map each modality concatenated with the labels to their own latent space and a third encoder takes $[x_{cal}, x_{rna}]$ and maps to a shared latent space. There are 2 decoders, which take $[z_{cal/rna}, z_{shared}, y_{cal/rna}]$ as input and reconstruct $\hat{x}_{cal/rna}$.

#### Code
- `train_multimodal.py` is used for training the MSVAE and evaluating the latent representation and reconstruction using different metrics.
- `sim_benchmark_mult.sh` runs `train_multimodal.py` for specified parameters
- `benchmark_mult.py` generates plots with representation and reconstruction metrics

## Data

Data available upon request.
- Real data from primary cortical neurons fro rat and mouse DIV 7 and 12 respectively.
- Simulated multimodal data: calcium traces simulated with the Izhikevic model and scRNA-seq matching data.

## Installation and use
To execute any code, first proceed with installation of [CaGenNet](https://github.com/AbanteLab/CaGenNet).

To execute any `train*.py` (first choose if executing a single time or for several parameter combinations). In the first case, comment argument parser and uncomment fixed parameters. In the second case:
1. Comment fixed parameters & uncomment argument parser
2. Set paramter loops in corresponding `.sh` file
3. Run `bash *.sh` on terminal from the directory
